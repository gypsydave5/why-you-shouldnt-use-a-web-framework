It was somewhat inflamatory - so I guess I should've expected the hate.

(it was worse on Twitter)

But it did help me think about what it was that I was on about... Get some clarity in my thoughts

and try and write something a little more measured. It also meant that a few people came out of
the wood work to give me some further reading, and watching, such as...

## A Framework Author's Case Against Frameworks

This is a great talk by Adrian Holovaty, who co-wrote the Python web framework Django. It's a really good watch - he's talking about JavaScript frameworks (he's at a JS conference). I'll mention what he says as we continue

# Two good blog posts

### [How it feels to learn JavaScript in 2016](https://hackernoon.com/how-it-feels-to-learn-javascript-in-2016-d3a717dd577f)

### ["It's the Future"](https://circleci.com/blog/its-the-future/)

???

And these two fun blog posts which are worth a read and dramatise _some_ of the things I'm talking about today.

The talk is all online and built using a framework because I embrace irony, so you can read and click and watch to your leisure later.

# #Beginners?

???

The reason I've come along to Makers to talk to you is that a lot of the criticism I got was because I tagged this post up as being for beginners. And so I thought I should try and share my thoughts, and why I think they're relevant to people like you - like us - who are learning web development.

All sound like indigestion medication to me.

That's how I feel - indigested. Am I meant to know about all of these? Can I evaluate all of these?

These were all things that I plucked out of my brain - I didn't need to look them up.

# Overload

???

When I was learning this stuff here, AngularJS was getting a foothold for JavaScript SPAs, but people used things like Backbone too, along with Ember. Within months that had turned into React. Then it was Angular 2. Then Vue. Now Backbone's not cool. Is React still Cool? What am I meant to use react with? Is Redux still cool? Or is it Redux Sagas? Or Thunks? Or...

This is the crap that goes through my head when I'm trying to get some work done. What am I meant to do? Is this 'cool'? And I've been doing this for nigh-on four years. What's it like now for you guys who have been doing it for four _weeks_?

# Good News!

## _YOU DON'T NEED ANY OF THEM_

???

So I've got some good news!

---
class: middle

# You only _need_

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- A Web Server + HTTP Library

---
class: center, middle

# Objections!

???

so why might this be bad idea?

---
class: middle, center

# Q: But it's hard

---
class: middle, center

# A: Modern HTML, CSS, JS have modern APIs

???

A lot (not all) of these frameworks are from THE WAY BEFORE TIMES, when JavaScript was (even more) horrible, HTML was built of `div`s and CSS was what you used to make text blink.


---
# HTML

```html
<article>
  <h1>Behold HTML 5</h1>
  <section>
    <p>Glorious, semantic HTML!</p>
    <p>Look - it's a date!</p>
  </section>
  <date>1/1/1970</date>
  <aside>(It's the tops!)</aside>
</article>
```

???

Things are grown up now! HTML 5 will describe a page in `section`s with `aside`s and other glorious semantic fun!

---
# CSS

```css
article {
   display: flex;
   box-sizing: border-box;
}

article date {
   font-weight: 800;
   flex: 1 1 auto;
}

article aside {
   background: blue;
   flex: 1 1 auto;
}
```

???

CSS 3 has beautiful things like `flexbox` and `grid` to let us lay out a page quickly, simply and responsively!

---
# JavaScript

```javascript
function whootAlert () {
  fetch('http://www.google.com')
    .then(response => response.body())
    .then(alert)
}

document.querySelectorAll('date')
    .forEach(element => {
      element.addEventListener('click', whootAlert)
    })
```

???

And JavaScript is... well JavaScript is still The Hardest Programming Language You'll Ever Learn (TM), but it's been extended to include BEAUTIFUL ways of interacting with a website, a SIMPLER syntax, and actually usable ways of making an HTTP request - all baked in to your browser!

---
# Web Server / HTTP Library

```ruby
def say_hello_world
  response = Rack::Response.new
  response.status = 200
  response.set_header 'Content-Type', 'text/html'
  response.write "<h1>Hello World</h2>"
  response
end
```

???

Web Server / HTTP Library ... well, this might be a bit trickier for you. Many languages will now provide a built in way of creating an HTTP server, and some convenience functions/classes around HTTP requests and responses. Go is a good example, but also things like HTTP4J in Kotlin, or Rack in Ruby, are good examples of a lightweight 'library' approach to building a server.

That said, and despite my best wishes, I can understand why you might use a lightweight framework approach - something like Sinatra. But take a look at Rack on its own sometime! It might be all you need. The same goes for Java - take a look at something like [uttlerlyidle](https://github.com/bodar/utterlyidle) - or even [Spark](http://sparkjava.com/) before you use something like Spring.

# Q: But it's slow

---
class: middle, center

# A: Not in my experience

???

In my experience, the time I spend guffing around with a framework's configuration for some plugin to implement some feature is _often_ greater than the time I'd spend just doing it myself.

# Q: But I won't get a job unless I know RegurgitateJS!

---
class: middle, center

# A: Recruitment is Broken

???

This might actually be true. Recruitment in software development is horrifically faddy, especially when it comes to front end frameworks. But it's the same for the back end too, just with different buzzword technologies.

This is a good reason to put some of these buzzwords on a CV. This is not a good reason to use them.

# Feel Empowered

???

Look, I want you to come away from this feeling not overwhelmed, but empowered. I want you to know that, fundamentally, you need to know four things  - HTML, CSS, JS and a Server - and how to glue them all together with a browser. You don't need to know them inside out - you just need to know enough to implement the next feature.
