It was somewhat inflamatory - so I guess I should've expected the hate.

(it was worse on Twitter)

But it did help me think about what it was that I was on about... Get some clarity in my thoughts

and try and write something a little more measured. It also meant that a few people came out of
the wood work to give me some further reading, and watching, such as...

# Adrian Holovaty
## A Framework Author's Case Against Frameworks

<iframe width="672" height="378" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/VvOsegaN9Wk" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen></iframe>

This is a great talk by Adrian Holovaty, who co-wrote the Python web framework Django. It's a really good watch - he's talking about JavaScript frameworks (he's at a JS conference). I'll mention what he says as we continue

# #Beginners?

???

The reason I've come along to Makers to talk to you is that a lot of the criticism I got was because I tagged this post up as being for beginners. And so I thought I should try and share my thoughts, and why I think they're relevant to people like you - like us - who are learning web development.

All sound like indigestion medication to me.

That's how I feel - indigested. Am I meant to know about all of these? Can I evaluate all of these?

These were all things that I plucked out of my brain - I didn't need to look them up.

# Overload

???

When I was learning this stuff here, AngularJS was getting a foothold for JavaScript SPAs, but people used things like Backbone too, along with Ember. Within months that had turned into React. Then it was Angular 2. Then Vue. Now Backbone's not cool. Is React still Cool? What am I meant to use react with? Is Redux still cool? Or is it Redux Sagas? Or Thunks? Or...

This is the crap that goes through my head when I'm trying to get some work done. What am I meant to do? Is this 'cool'? And I've been doing this for nigh-on four years. What's it like now for you guys who have been doing it for four _weeks_?

# Good News!

## _YOU DON'T NEED THEM_

# You only need

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- A Web Server + HTTP Library (you choose the language!)

# YAGNI / MVP

???

So, have we all learned what these two acronyms mean?

- YAGNI = You Ain't Gonna Need It
- MVP = Minimum Viable Product

### With respect to Frontend Frameworks...

# Is a Single Page App _ever_ MVP?

???

Is it? What's the thing that I can't achieve by rendering pages on the server? Is that thing the first iteration? The second iteration? Frameworks might be what you need at the end, but I hate the idea of us losing the iterative model of development

# Q: But it's hard

# Q: But it's slow

---
class: middle, center

# A: Not in my experience

???

In my experience, the time I spend guffing around with a framework's configuration for some plugin to implement some feature is _often_ greater than the time I'd spend just doing it myself.

# A: Recruitment is Broken

???

This might actually be true. Recruitment in software development is horrifically faddy, especially when it comes to front end frameworks. But it's the same for the back end too, just with different buzzword technologies.

This is a good reason to put some of these buzzwords on a CV. This is not a good reason to use them.

# Feel Empowered

???

Look, I want you to come away from this feeling not overwhelmed, but empowered. I want you to know that, fundamentally, you need to know four things  - HTML, CSS, JS and a Server - and how to glue them all together with a browser. You don't need to know them inside out - you just need to know enough to implement the next feature.
